# Intelligence mindset shapes neural learning signals and memory

Intelligence mindset, which denotes individual beliefs about whether intelligence is fixed versus malleable, shapes academic success, but the neural mechanisms underlying mindset-related differences in learning are unknown. Here, we probe the effects of mindset on neural responses to negative feedback after a competence threat manipulation. We hypothesized that when their competence was threatened, participants with fixed mindsets would interpret further negative feedback as punishing. After receiving either no score or a competence-threatening score on a purported IQ test, participants performed a learning task with two feedback contexts that emphasized either the evaluative or informational weight of negative feedback. Participants who experienced the competence threat had the strongest predictive relationships between mindset, performance, and caudate activation. For fixed mindsets, the competence threat may have compounded the subjective punishment of negative feedback, causing poorer learning from negative feedback in the evaluative context and inflexible striatal responses to negative feedback across feedback contexts. 

## Highlights: 

*	We probe the neural correlates of intelligence mindset after a competence threat
*	Mindset predicted task performance and caudate activation to negative feedback
*	These relationships were strongest for those who received the competence threat
*	Fixed mindsets performed worse in the evaluative, negative feedback context
*	Fixed mindsets consistently showed striatal punishment dips to negative feedback
