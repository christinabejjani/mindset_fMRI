# Intelligence mindset shapes neural learning signals and memory

The ability to learn from performance feedback is critical to academic achievement, but its relationship with intelligence mindset (i.e., individual beliefs about whether intelligence is fluid or fixed) remains poorly understood. After taking a purported IQ test, which resulted in either no score or a competence-threatening score, participants performed a paired-associate word learning task with two feedback contexts that differentially manipulated the predictability of feedback receipt. Intelligence mindset predicted task performance and BOLD activation in a critical reinforcement learning-related region, the caudate; these relationships were driven by the competence threat. For participants with fixed views of their intelligence, receiving a low IQ score may have further compounded the performance threat provided by negative feedback, causing poorer learning from negative feedback in one context and an inflexible neural response to negative feedback across feedback contexts. Our results highlight motivational factors that can affect engagement in classroom settings and educational outcomes.
