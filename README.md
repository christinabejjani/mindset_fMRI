# Intelligence mindset shapes neural learning signals and memory

Intelligence  mindset,  which  denotesindividual  beliefs  about  whether  intelligence  is  fixed versus  malleable,  shapes academic  success,  but the  neural  mechanisms  underlying  mindset-related differences in learningare unknown. Here, weprobethe effects ofindividual differences inmindset on neural responses to negative feedback after a competence threat manipulation. We hypothesized that when their competence was threatened, participants with fixed mindsets would interpret further negative  feedback  as  punishing.  After  receiving  either  noscoreor  a  competence-threatening  IQ score, participants performed a learning task with feedback that emphasized either the evaluative or informational weightof negative feedback. Participants who experienced the competence threat had the  strongest predictive relationshipsbetween  mindset,  performance,and caudate activation.Thecompetence threat may have compounded the subjective punishment of negative feedbackfor fixed mindsetsrelative  to  growth  mindsets, causing  poorer  learning  from  negative  feedback  in  the evaluative context and inflexible striatal responsesto negative feedback across feedback contexts.

## Highlights: 

*	We probe the neural correlates of intelligence mindset after a competence threat
*	Mindset predicted task performance and caudate activation to negative feedback
*	These relationships were stronger in the threat vs. non-threat conditions
*	Fixed mindsets performed worse than growth mindsets in the evaluative context
*	Fixed mindsets consistently showed striatal punishment dips to negative feedback
